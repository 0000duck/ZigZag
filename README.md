# ZigZag
ZigZag is a tool for creating interactive realtime visual effects and computer graphics.
It borrows ideas from TouchDesigner and Vuo, but it is not trying to mimic either.
At the moment ZigZag is in a very early stage of development, And not yet at a point where it is practically usable.
Feel free to help in the development of ZigZag!
